# RGB Dinos

I built this tiny game with some free assets from itch.io, there are only 4 levels right now because I was more focussed on getting the mechanics and game flow implemented than building a fleshed out platformer.

Your dinosaur cycles between 3 colors - Red, Green and Blue. The blocks that match the current dinosaur color will be transparent, and your dinosaur will pass through them.

Don't touch the spikes, or fall off the stage or you'll die!
